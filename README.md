## **Books List (Flask + DataTables + 3rd Party Templates)**

A Flask project focused on learning and experimenting with **template management and front-end integration**. The project includes basic CRUD functionality for managing books, but the main emphasis is on **creating, modifying, and testing templates**.

This project uses **DataTables** to enhance table displays with sorting, search, and pagination. It’s designed so you can easily swap or experiment with different CSS frameworks or UI templates without affecting the backend.

The project demonstrates multiple template approaches, including **Generic**, **UI Toolkit**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. This allows you to see how different frameworks and template structures affect the layout, styling, and overall user experience, making it easy to compare and test various front-end solutions in the same project.

A **sample SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`)** is included with preloaded tables and test data for books and categories.
